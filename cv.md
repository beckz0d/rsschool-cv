#### About myself 
I am from the sunny city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan. I am 35 years old. At the moment I work in one company as an expert and decided to change my profession in the direction of a front-end developer. Since childhood, I have been very good at computer technology, unfortunately or fortunately, consciousness came only when I realized that I needed to do programming. I still do not have any experience, I hope I will not stop learning and reaching heights with the help of this profession
